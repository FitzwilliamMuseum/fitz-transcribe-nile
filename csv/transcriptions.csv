https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-001_Chunk1.mp3,like so many objects from ancient Egypt it's associated with death because it was originally attached to the front of a coffin at the top
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-001_Chunk10.mp3,and the religious beliefs that affected their preparations for Death so as well as appreciating the beauty of an object like this space

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-001_Chunk9.mp3,the Crossman who worked on them we also want you to get to know the ancient Egyptian people who were buried in these coffins the economic times

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-002_Chunk1.mp3,the Nile which flows roughly from South to North most Egyptian towns and villages like close to it and within the floodplain
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-002_Chunk10.mp3,add food and the right thoughts of Status symbols with them after death these things suggest that there was some kind of belief in an afterlife
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-002_Chunk11.mp3,early period
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-002_Chunk2.mp3,to the Eastern West or deserts with the Sahara on one side and the Eastern desert on the other the ancient Egyptians chose to be

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-003_Chunk12.mp3,and Helen whose body would have been placed in it lying on one side and facing the front the body would have been stretched out
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-003_Chunk13.mp3,with its legs curled up like earlier variables his head would have been positioned close to the eyes on the outside of the Coffin so that he could mad

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-003_Chunk6.mp3,the plants attached to each other with a mixture of wooden dowels and mortise and tenon joints the corner the mitred with a joint at the top known as the butt joint

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk1.mp3,we can see one of the most important gods Osiris we can immediately tell which figure is Osiris because he has Green
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk10.mp3,Isis also brought Osiris back to live there are a few different versions of the story in 1 she turned herself into a
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk11.mp3,and what did the breath of life into his nostrils this is one reason why Isis and also know if this is sometimes shown with wings
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk12.mp3,after he came back to life Osiris became the king of the underworld
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk2.mp3,on his face of hands he's also shown wrapped up in white linen and he's got a white crown on his head which has two feathers either side
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk3.mp3,this is the crown of Southern Egypt which Osiris almost always wears and he's also holding his distinctive crook and Flail

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk7.mp3,the Egyptians believe that Osiris was the first king of Egypt and that he was murdered by his evil brother Seth
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-004_Chunk8.mp3,his wife Isis and her sister nephthys protected his dead body and we often find these two goddesses painted or carved on

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk0.mp3,looking at the Coffin of magi we can see that it is basically similar to earlier anthropoid coffins it's shaped like a body rather
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk1.mp3,Angela and it's made to look as if the body is wrapped in white linen with a mask over the head there are some obvious differences though
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk10.mp3,changed in different parts of the country model lived about 1500 to 1400 BC in the period
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk11.mp3,the new kingdom when Egypt had been reunited under the rule of a single king called are Jose her coffin is typical for the early New Kings
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk12.mp3,shortly after this the fashion in coffins changed again and all the white areas of a coffin like this
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk13.mp3,instead and we can see an example of this in the coffin of Tom eat which is shown in the same case both black and white cock
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk14.mp3,sometimes had gold text bands or gold leaf on the Faces cheaper coffins like Tommy's just had inscriptions and yellow pain
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk15.mp3,in fact her coffin was probably bought off the shelf Because We Can See Clearly that her name has been added to the Coffin after the main inscriptions were
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk2.mp3,instead of just a single line of inscription down the front there are more strips of inscription which run at right angles to the Central text line
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk3.mp3,and there is much more in the way of declaration there are images for example there's a depiction of Osiris of the God Anubis who was another of
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk4.mp3,God and mother and her husband sitting on a double chair there is also a website I on each side at the shoulders
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk5.mp3,at this period for the first time bodies were buried on their backs this coffin was not meant to be put on its side and it was not meant to be inside a rectangular
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk6.mp3,so the two eyes of the eye panel have been split and put on each side of the Coffin from this period onwards Egyptian coffee
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk7.mp3,signs that the dead were buried lying on their backs this change seems to be gone at about 16:50 BC during the
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk8.mp3,when Egypt was in turmoil this period is known as the second intermediate period it was a time when there was no central government and the country
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-008_Chunk9.mp3,attack from neighbouring countries in the North part of Egypt ruled by foreigners and has Egypt got more fragmented burial custom
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk0.mp3,the decoration on this coffin lid is typical for the end of the new kingdom about 1185 to 1070 BC
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk1.mp3,the shape is anthropoid and there's a central band of text running down the front with other strips of text at right angles to it in between areas
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk10.mp3,and especially good quality wood was an expensive material and was reused also from this time there are records of investor
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk11.mp3,robberies in fact recent studies are showing that very many coffins were reused and given a makeover during this period
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk2.mp3,so we talk back to earlier and support coffins but it's much more elaborate if we look at the edge of the lid or it would have joined
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk3.mp3,coughing something amazing there is order decoration underneath the current finished surface once you start to look you can see many
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk4.mp3,pictures of this older surface appearing where the current service has been lost or damaged in fact they're of linens glued over the original coffin decoration
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk5.mp3,then covered with a new layer of paste and the common decoration applied on Top the new decoration and inscriptions tell us at the Coffin as we see

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk7.mp3,the Ray traces of earlier inscriptions that we can see that it isn't possible to tell who the original owner was
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk8.mp3,idea of reusing coffins seems quite strange especially when we think that Egyptians were so concerned with making sure that they continue to live in the afterlife
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-009_Chunk9.mp3,but maybe there are ideas of how long for ever lasted would different to ours we do know that at all periods
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk0.mp3,all the parts of coffins you see here come from one group of coffins made for a man called mess power Sheffield

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk10.mp3,the best cello colour of the mummy board in a coffin comes from a wash containing the Ground Up yellow mineral called opponent which is an arsenic sulphide

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk14.mp3,I picked up the lid to move it before the varnish was dry with another interesting thing you can see in the varnish on the mummy board

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk4.mp3,how many surprises under the almost perfect surface are made of long planks and actually constructed from several pieces of wood cleverly joint
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk5.mp3,and a lot of places the sections clearly made of reused wood some of which appears to come from earlier coffins the lid of the in a coffin
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk6.mp3,split during manufacture and had to be repaired using a small cramp across the chest the Cramp is flooded at both ends and is known as the butterfly crab
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk7.mp3,before the coffins for decorators all the gaps and floors were filled with the coarse calcite paste on the motherboard
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk8.mp3,the wing area was built up using a coarse Brown paste made of clay and calcite on the inner coffin of textile was glued over most of the wood
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-010_Chunk9.mp3,I help make a good surface for the decoration on top of this for the level of fine white calcite paste then the decoration was
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk0.mp3,this coffin is different from the others have seen so far because it's not made of wood is made of linen and animal glue
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk1.mp3,cereal cotton are the weights produced is a bit like making a papier mache igloo replaced over and Mummy shaped core that was made of money
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk10.mp3,down the front of the mummy case this also tells us that his father his grandfather and his great grandfather all did the same job
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk11.mp3,his great great grandfather is also listed on there as a priest in the same temple of death burial was

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk13.mp3,afterwards we have most of the burial equipment found with him which you can see displayed here to including the box of tiny figures

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk15.mp3,it may well have been in bad condition after it is removed from the mummy case and unwrapped we do know when he died though because the
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk16.mp3,it's reported that some of the linen around his body was inscribed with the date that we can equate to about 900 BC
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-011_Chunk2.mp3,and coated with coarse chips and paste The Pretenders left uncovered then the slit was cut all the way up the bag and the core was scraped out

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk10.mp3,there was often a statue of Anubis on the top of the lid and figures of Falcon shaped God's were sometimes perched on the
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk11.mp3,the corner posts so it was quite an elaborate structure and inside they would have been at least two more anthropoid coffins nested one
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk12.mp3,the other like Russian dolls
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk2.mp3,listen to the ancient Egyptians because it was where they believe the God Osiris was buried the Coffin was originally over two and a half m
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk3.mp3,and over a metre wide these panels are acacia wood they've been carved create lines of texts which have then been filled with paste

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk5.mp3,fencing material in Acacia panel has holes drilled through it they we used to get to the underlying carcass of the Coffin using wooden dowels
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk6.mp3,on the back some of the panels we found remains of animal glue so it looks as if they were stuck on as well as paid the carcass itself which was probably made
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk7.mp3,quality timber has survived and we suspect it may been eaten by insects that some of the veneer panels were attacked by termites
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk8.mp3,cute corner post on the same coffin has also survived is disposed separately together with a modern reconstruction of a post which shows how it fitted onto the car
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-012_Chunk9.mp3,coffins with this kind of corner post and known as Kersey coffins the lid of the Coffin would have been voted or curved
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk0.mp3,these two coffins Were Made For A Man Called Parker poo he was a water pourer on the west of Thieves about 680 to 6
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk1.mp3,BC this means that he was someone who was employed by Rich families to look after the Cult of their dead relatives
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk10.mp3,flatbase the feet of the two coffins are also different both coffins are basically made of Sycamore
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk11.mp3,I explain them we can see that the logic often was constructed from an extraordinary number of pieces of wood including some parts made of a jigsaw of small
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk12.mp3,fitting bits and lots of slither of the wood inserted into gaps we can also see that the timber been damaged by insects before the Coffin was put together
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk13.mp3,maybe you have been lying around for a while before it was used the gaps and other large spaces with then filled up with a course pink paste would you can see where the
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk14.mp3,has been lost what has been shaped differently and better made the inner coffin is different in the way it's been decorated
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk15.mp3,the Coffin has been covered with a couple of layers of linen and glue more like a material known as cotton and the decoration painted on it runs over the joint
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk16.mp3,send it in the box for the body must have been inside the Coffin before the decoration was applied this makes it very like a cartoon ice mummies case
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk17.mp3,that probably explains why the box has a curved shape you will also see that was a plinth under the feet this is like the space left for attaching a football
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk2.mp3,his key functions would have been to visit the teams regularly and Paul water as part of the offering rituals that the dead needed to continue in the afterlife
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk3.mp3,is pay came in the form of produce from land allocated to him by the family he was not one of the highest rank
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk4.mp3,in the area and you can see that the quality of the inscriptions and decoration is not the best the coffins would have been one inside the other

https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk8.mp3,means that he was being shown as a god probably Osiris but on the other coffin he has a short straight beard and an Egyptian
https://fitz-audio-guide-micropasts.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Nile-013_Chunk9.mp3,that signifies he's an ordinary man the box of the Inner coffin is also much more curved underneath and the larger one which has a
